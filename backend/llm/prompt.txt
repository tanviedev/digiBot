You are analyzing social media content performance.

Rules for reasoning:
- If performance_status is underperforming, identify what limited reach or engagement
- If save_rate or share_rate is high, content delivered value
- If hook_strength is weak, the opening failed to retain attention
- If fatigue_level is high, the audience may be oversaturated
- If timing_quality is good, timing was NOT the issue
- If intent_match is misaligned, message and audience expectation differ
